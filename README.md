# Online Checkout Pricing Service ( OCPS )

I developed this OCPS full stack solution in response to a coding challenge. Feel free to reuse as you find it suitable to any of your application.

The following essential features are required as part of the user story:

* Users will be able to add multiple items, and display the total price.
* Service will calculate the total using the pricing rules provided by the following: [json  service](https://api.myjson.com/bins/gx6vz)
* Whenever a special quantity of an item is selected, special_price should be used for that instead of the normal pricing.
